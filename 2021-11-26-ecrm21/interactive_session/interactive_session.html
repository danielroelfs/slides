                    You are the researchers behind a new, innovative drug for patients with schizophrenia. 
                    The drug is called "<em>Miraculin</em>", and in your recent clinical trial, 82% of all patients that used Miraculin (<em>N</em>=154) had no relapses in the 5 year follow-up, compared to 18% in the placebo-group (<em>N</em>=156). 
                    Unfortunately, the drug is associated with some rather unusual side effects. 
                    In your trial, you found that 42% of the patients experienced paralysis of the upper eyelids (ptosis), making it hard for the patients to keep their eyes open. 
                    Furthermore, 7% of the females and 19% of the males reported of unexpected hair loss (alopecia areata). 
                    Another surprise from the clinical trial was the finding of an association between reduced risk of relapse in users of Miraculin and vegetarian diets. 
                    Compared to non-vegetarian diets, vegetarian diets were associated with lower risk of relapse (OR 0.67, 95%CI 0.41-0.86, <em>p</em>=0.03) in users of Miraculin. 
                    In other words, vegetarian diets seemed to improve the effect of Miraculin on risk of relapse. 
                    The mechanism of action for Miraculin is not fully understood. 
                    However, it is hypothesized that Miraculin blocks the NP<sub>4</sub>-receptor, a newly discovered receptor in the central nervous system. 
                    It is now time that these findings are presented for the rest of the world. 
                    The pharmaceutical company want a modern and highly untraditional marketing. Accordingly, your researcher team have received the following requests:
